# Dijkstra's Ghost

> if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would be enough immortality for me. —Edsger Dijkstra (1995) "Introducing a course on calculi"
